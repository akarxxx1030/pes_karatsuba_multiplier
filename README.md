## Karatsuba Algorithm for Multiplication

The **Karatsuba algorithm** is a fast multiplication algorithm that reduces the multiplication of two large numbers to a smaller number of single-digit multiplications, effectively improving the computational complexity of the multiplication operation. It was developed by Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba in 1960 and is based on the principle of divide-and-conquer.

### Algorithm Overview
The fundamental idea behind Karatsuba multiplication is to break down the multiplication of large numbers into smaller multiplications by splitting the numbers into smaller parts, using recursion to perform the necessary multiplications efficiently, and combining the results.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Given two large numbers, split each into two parts of equal size.
2. Recursively compute three multiplications of these smaller parts.
3. Combine the results using addition and subtraction to obtain the final product.

### Implementation in Pseudocode

```python
function karatsuba_multiply(x, y):
    if x < 10 or y < 10:
        return x * y
    
    n = max(length(x), length(y))
    n_2 = n // 2
    
    # Splitting the numbers into parts
    a, b = split_number(x, n_2)
    c, d = split_number(y, n_2)
    
    # Recursive steps
    ac = karatsuba_multiply(a, c)
    bd = karatsuba_multiply(b, d)
    ad_bc = karatsuba_multiply(a + b, c + d) - ac - bd
    
    # Combining results
    return (10**(2*n_2) * ac) + (10**n_2 * ad_bc) + bd
